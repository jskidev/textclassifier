Text Classifier

https://text-lab.herokuapp.com/

This is a simple react app with a node & express backend. It currently accepts a basic text input and then uses the tensorflow 'text toxicity detection' machine learning model to analyse the input. It assesses for identity attacks, insults, obscenity, severe toxicity, sexual explicitness, threats, and toxicity.

In progress is the ability to upload a csv and analyse sentences in bulk.

It also has a simple threejs webGL icosahedron interactable animation on the home page.
